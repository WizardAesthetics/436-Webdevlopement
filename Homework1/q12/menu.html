          <p>Beef Wellington is a steak dish of English origin,
            made out of fillet steak coated with pate and duxelles,
            wrapped in puff pastry, then baked. Some recipes include
            wrapping the coated meat in a crepe or parma ham to retain
            the moisture and prevent it from making the pastry soggy</p>

          <p>Braising is a combination of dry and moist cooking methods where you sear the meat and then bake the meat
            in a liquid. It sounds intimidating, but it's actually a very straightforward cooking method and yields
            delicious results that taste gourmet.</p>

          <p>Chicken scallopini can be cooked in a variety of sauces and flavors. We departed from the piccata herd and
            went instead for tender mushrooms and a hint of wine, lemon, and broth, capped off with a dash of rich
            cream: scaloppine ai funghi. Cheers to a perfectly light yet hearty weeknight meal.</p>

          <p>perfectly cooked salmon that’s juicy inside can be served plain because it’s an oily fish with plenty of
            flavour in the flesh. With the crispy skin as an extra element, it really doesn’t need anything else except
            perhaps a wedge of lemon!</p>
