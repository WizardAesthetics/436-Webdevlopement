        <pre style="text-align:left">
    Developed apps such as calculators, 3D renders and file convertors. Used an agile workflow 
    with GitLab as version control.Programmed in C++ and in Delphi, an object-oriented version 
    of Pascal to make apps that would be sold to clients for professional use. Used math such 
    as matrix multiplication and linear algebra; to come up with solutions for calculators and 
    turning 2d coordinate into 3d coordinate for a 3d render. Had to meet deadlines and stay in 
    constant contact with my supervisor, to ensure I would meet my time requirements with all 
    the specified functionality. </pre>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">Ford Community Corps Internship</h3>
        <pre style="text-align:left">
    Developed a training game for DCTP. Creating features such as: movement, map building and User 
    Interface (UI). Used a scrum-based workflow with GitHub for version control. Worked in Unity 
    and learned C# on the job before having actual training in my gaming class, I had to look for 
    creative and elegant solutions to problems.Used debugging techniques to find quick solutions to 
    problems, as well as maintaining the GitHub to keep it up to date and organized for a smooth 
    working process.Organized and made future lists from the back log. Set deadlines for us to meetso 
    the project would stay on track. Meeting with teammates regularly to help troubleshoot problems
    they may have encountered.

        <pre style="text-align:left">
    Created and managed databases, using techniques such as: AVLTrees, Binary Search Trees and Hash Tables.
    Used Java, in eclipse to create a text file database to hold student information.
    Developed classes and methods to segment code that was used often. 
    Implemented my own AVLTree and Hash Table classes to use as data structures.
